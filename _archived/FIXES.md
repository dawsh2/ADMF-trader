# ADMF-Trader Code Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address critical issues in the ADMF-Trader system, particularly focusing on the event system and component integration.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Event System Fixes

#### Fixed Event Serialization
- Fixed the event serialization in `Event._prepare_data_for_serialization` method by changing `value` to `data` in the serialization of datetime and Enum objects.
- This allows proper JSON serialization of events, which is critical for system diagnostics and event replay.

#### Added Missing Event Bus Methods
- Added the `has_handlers` method to `EventBus` class to check if there are handlers registered for a given event type.
- This method is required by tests and helps with diagnosing event registration issues.

### 2. Event Utils Fixes

#### Fixed Order Parameter Order
- Fixed the signature of `create_order_event` in `event_utils.py` to match the expected parameter order in tests and documentation.
- The corrected signature now properly places `direction` first, followed by `quantity`, `symbol`, and `order_type`.

### 3. Strategy Fixes

#### Fixed MA Crossover Strategy Initialization
- Added missing fields to `MACrossoverStrategy` class initialization: `fast_ma`, `slow_ma`, and `current_position`.
- Updated the `reset` method to properly clear these fields.
- This ensures proper state management in the strategy, preventing missing attribute errors.

#### Fixed Abstract Method Implementation
- Added the required `on_bar` implementation to the test `TestStrategy` class in `test_strategy_portfolio_flow.py`.
- This allows for proper instantiation of the test strategy class.

### 4. Portfolio Manager Fixes

#### Added Missing Methods
- Added `get_positions` method to `PortfolioManager` to return all positions.
- Added `get_equity_curve` method to return the equity curve data.
- These methods are required by various tests and components.

## Test Scripts

Several test scripts have been created to verify the fixes:

1. `test_event_system.py` - Tests the event system's core functionality.
2. `test_portfolio.py` - Tests the portfolio manager implementation.
3. `test_ma_strategy.py` - Tests the MA Crossover strategy.
4. `test_integration.py` - Tests the complete event flow from strategy signal to portfolio update.

Run all tests with:

```bash
python run_all_tests.py
```

## Next Steps

While these fixes address the critical issues found in the tests, additional improvements can be made:

1. Improve error handling throughout the system.
2. Add more comprehensive test coverage, particularly for edge cases.
3. Standardize the API for all components to ensure consistent parameter naming and ordering.
4. Implement a more robust idempotent event processing mechanism.
5. Enhance logging for better diagnostics.

These fixes create a solid foundation for implementing the optimization module as outlined in the pre-optimization improvements document.
