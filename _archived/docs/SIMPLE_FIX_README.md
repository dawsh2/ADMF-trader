# Simple Fix for ADMF-Trader Optimization

This is a simplified fix for the ADMF-Trader optimization issues that focuses on the core problems.

## What This Fixes

1. **Reporter Error**: Fixes the "NoneType object has no attribute 'items'" error by adding checks for None values.

2. **Missing Trades**: Ensures trades are created and recorded when orders are filled.

## How to Use

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x run_simple_fix.sh

# Run with your config file
./run_simple_fix.sh config/ma_crossover_fixed_symbols.yaml
```

## Why This Approach Works Better

Unlike the previous fixes that attempted to modify multiple files directly (leading to syntax errors), this approach uses Python's runtime patching capabilities to:

1. **Monkey Patch Critical Methods**: Modifies the behavior of key methods without directly editing file content, avoiding syntax errors.

2. **Focus on Core Issues**: Directly addresses just the essential problems without trying to change too much.

3. **More Resilient**: Adapts to your specific codebase structure rather than assuming specific implementations.

## What to Expect

When you run the script:

1. The reporter is patched to handle None values properly
2. The execution handler is patched to ensure trades are created and recorded
3. The optimization is run with these patches applied

If you still see best_parameters as None in the results, that likely means there were no valid parameter combinations found (which is different from crashing with an error).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs in `simple_fix.log` for detailed information
2. Try increasing logging to see what's happening during the optimization:
   ```bash
   ./run_simple_fix.sh config/ma_crossover_fixed_symbols.yaml --verbose
   ```
3. Check that your order manager is passing rule_id correctly (updated fix already applied)
