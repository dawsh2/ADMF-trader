# Updates to the Deduplication Solution

## Enhanced Rule ID Filter Improvements

We've made several improvements to the `EnhancedRuleIdFilter` to address edge cases and improve robustness:

### 1. Fixed Weakref Handler Error

The original implementation was causing this error in the logs:
```
TypeError: WeakMethod.__call__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
```

We fixed this by updating the wrapped emit method to properly handle variadic arguments:

```python
def wrapped_emit(event, *args, **kwargs):
    # Check logic here
    # ...
    
    # Pass all arguments to the original method
    return original_emit(event, *args, **kwargs)
```

This ensures that any additional arguments passed to the emit method are properly forwarded to the original method, preventing the TypeError.

### 2. Improved Error Handling

We've enhanced the error handling throughout the filter to gracefully handle exceptions:

- Added try/except blocks around critical operations
- Improved logging for error conditions
- Added fallback behavior when exceptions occur

### 3. Better Cleanup

We've improved the `restore_emit()` method to handle potential errors during cleanup:

```python
def restore_emit(self):
    """Restore the original emit method."""
    if hasattr(self, 'original_emit') and self.original_emit:
        try:
            self.event_bus.emit = self.original_emit
            logger.info("Original emit method restored")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error restoring emit method: {e}")
    else:
        logger.warning("No original emit method to restore")
```

This ensures that the event bus is always returned to a clean state, even if errors occur during the restoration process.

### 4. Updated Tests

We've also updated the test scripts to properly handle the cleanup process:

```python
# Clean up - safely restore original emit method
try:
    rule_filter.restore_emit()
    logger.info("Successfully restored original emit method")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error restoring emit method: {e}")
```

## Results

The improved implementation successfully addresses the signal deduplication issue:

1. The first signal with a given rule_id is processed normally
2. Subsequent signals with the same rule_id are blocked at the emit level
3. Only one order is created per unique rule_id

The solution now works reliably without generating errors in the logs.

## Recommendation

We recommend using the `EnhancedRuleIdFilter` as the primary solution for the deduplication issue. It provides the strongest protection by completely blocking duplicate signals at the source, before they can flow through the event system.

For a defense-in-depth approach, it can be combined with the other solutions (SignalPreprocessor, EnhancedRiskManager, etc.) for maximum protection against duplicate signals.
