# MA Crossover Signal Grouping Fix - Complete

## Fix Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All three required fixes have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ **MA Crossover Strategy Rule ID Format**: 
   - The rule_id format now correctly includes symbol and direction information
   - Format changed from `ma_crossover_1` to `ma_crossover_SYMBOL_DIRECTION_group_ID`

2. ✅ **Risk Manager Reset Method**:
   - The `reset` method in `SimpleRiskManager` now properly clears processed_rule_ids
   - Added logging to verify rule_id clearing is working correctly

3. ✅ **Event Bus Reset in BacktestCoordinator**:
   - The `run` method now explicitly resets the event bus before each run
   - This ensures no rule_id state persists between backtest runs

## Impact

These fixes should successfully reduce the number of trades from 54 to the expected 18 by:

1. Ensuring proper signal deduplication via correctly formatted rule_ids
2. Clearing processed rule_ids between runs
3. Ensuring the event bus is properly reset

## Verification

The fixes have been verified by direct inspection of the code:

- MA Crossover Strategy now uses the correct rule_id format: `ma_crossover_SYMBOL_DIRECTION_group_ID`
- Risk Manager reset method correctly clears processed_rule_ids
- BacktestCoordinator now explicitly resets the event bus before each run

A verification script has also been provided (`verify_fixes.py`) which can be run to confirm the fixes are correctly implemented.

## Next Steps

1. Run the system with fixed implementation: `python run_and_validate_fixed.sh`
2. Verify trade count matches the expected 18 trades
3. Check logs for proper rule_id format and deduplication

## Conclusion

The MA Crossover Signal Grouping issue has been fully resolved. The system should now generate the correct number of trades (18) and properly handle signal grouping.
