# ADMF-Trader Modular Rewrite Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of the ADMF-Trader modular rewrite as outlined in the `modular_rewrite.md` document.

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Core Event System

- [x] Created core directory structure
- [x] Implemented EventType class
- [x] Implemented Event class
- [x] Implemented EventBus class with deduplication
- [x] Created test cases for Event and EventBus
- [x] Implemented Component base class
- [x] Created test runner for event system tests

### Phase 2: Dependency Injection and Configuration

- [x] Implemented Container class for dependency injection
- [x] Implemented Config class for configuration management
- [x] Created Bootstrap module for system initialization
- [x] Updated main.py to use the bootstrap system
- [x] Created sample configuration file
- [x] Simplified command-line interface

### Phase 3: Key Infrastructure

- [ ] Implement data handling components
- [ ] Implement strategy base classes
- [ ] Implement risk management components
- [ ] Implement execution components

## Next Steps

1. **Complete data handling components**:
   - Implement DataHandler interface
   - Implement CSV data source
   - Implement bar transformers

2. **Implement strategy framework**:
   - Create strategy base class
   - Implement strategy component model
   - Create moving average strategy as example

3. **Implement risk and portfolio components**:
   - Create portfolio manager
   - Implement position tracking
   - Implement risk manager

4. **Implement execution components**:
   - Create order manager
   - Implement simulated broker
   - Implement fill handlers

5. **Implement backtest engine**:
   - Create backtest orchestrator
   - Implement performance analytics
   - Add reporting capabilities

## Testing Strategy

We're following a test-driven approach for the core components:

1. Unit tests for core classes (Event, EventBus, Container, Config)
2. Integration tests for component interactions
3. System tests for end-to-end functionality

The test structure mirrors the core architecture:

```
tests/
├── core/
│   ├── event_system/
│   │   └── test_event_system.py
│   ├── dependency_injection/
│   │   └── test_container.py
│   └── configuration/
│       └── test_config.py
├── data/
├── strategy/
├── risk/
├── execution/
└── backtesting/
```
