"""
Restore proper backtest behavior in ADMF-trader.

This script reverts the changes made to the OrderManager where artificial trade results were introduced.
It restores the proper trading behavior where trade results should be determined by the actual 
entry/exit prices based on the strategy, not random or artificially generated profits/losses.
